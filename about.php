 This study presents a comprehensive approach to designing a website aimed at collecting and analyzing reviews for Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered hospitals and care services. The website focuses on performing sentiment analysis of user reviews to assess perceived sentiment towards healthcare facilities. Additionally, two primary datasets are utilized: one for data visualization and another for applying machine learning algorithms. Key functionalities include user registration, authentication, and sentiment analysis impact on user engagement. Machine learning models are developed and evaluated for accuracy and reliability in predicting care quality, identifying optimal locations, and assessing provider performance based on the separate datasets. Personalized profiles and demographic filters are incorporated to tailor facility recommendations to user preferences. Mechanisms for continuous learning enhance model adaptability and performance over time, refining insights from user reviews across various categories including community mental health, adult inpatients, children and young people, maternity, and urgent and emergency care.
